I learned about the Spotipy lib from [this reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnpython/comments/dtyt2t/help_me_understand_this_spotipy_code/) by [u/The_Mann_In_Black](https://github.com/TheMannInBlack). u/The_Mann_In_Black had the fantastic idea of writing a script that unpacks song/artist data from the [nastily nested dictionary structore](https://github.com/Phillyclause89/MySpotipy/wiki/Spotipy-Track-Data-Structure) returned by the spotify API into a easire to read and export Pandas Dataframes.  In honor of  The_Mann_In_Black making the post that inroduced me to this script, I have forked his repo to server as my playground for learning about this API and to also practice UnitTesting.
